# object_follower
This example project uses the Layad Circuits 2WD Multi-role Robot Kit to create an "Object Following" robot. 3 ultrasonic sensors are needed. You will need 2 additional sensors as the standard kit only contain 1. The goal of the robot is to follow the object infront of it as it moves forward, left and right. The robot stops when the minimum and maximum distances are reached
